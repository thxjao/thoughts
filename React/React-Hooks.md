# React Hooks

In this notes i'll try to resume all react hooks usage, from the most used to the less.

## useState

It's the simplest but the most used hooks, so first we have to understand that react enables us to manage the state of the application, one time that we change a componet state, the react will re-render the element that are linked to this state.
